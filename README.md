# pubgStatz

A Project where we collect and analyze data from PUBG Developer API

## To-Do:
### Iteration 1: 
- [x] Get The API-requests Working
- [x] Get single player data, match data and match telemetry data using the API
- [x] Get huge amount of data from different matches and different players
- [ ] Save the data to database and sort and categorize it so it can be accessed later easily
- [ ] Analyze data from the database 
- [x] Visualize analyzed data with some sick ass graphs (in the first iteration this should be done as easily as possible. No front-end, react, js or any other stuff.) This is actually quite easy with seaborn. Just give it some data in array format and it will show a graph. The hard part is to parse, manipulate  and get the data from the rawdata files.
- [ ] Profit ???

### Iteration 2: 
-




## Things and ideas to analyze:
Note: All these things has to be sorted by game mode and map (solo-fpp, duo-fpp, squad-fpp and sanhok, vikendi, erangel and miramar) 
* Correlation between rank, and distance between landing location and first circle position
* Correlation between rank, and distance between landing location and sixth circle position
* Correlation between rank and jump time vs landing time
* Correlation between rank and jump distance from the jump point
* Correlation between rank and jump distance from the flight path
* Correlation between molotov usage and win%
* Correlation between molotov usage and kills
* Correlation between smoke usage and win%
* Correlation between smoke usage and kills
* Correlation between driving (distance?) in the first and second phase to rank (this has to be compared to others who dropped in the same location/ same distance)
* Correlation between driving (distance?) in the last phases to rank (this has to be compared to others who dropped in the same location/ same distance)
